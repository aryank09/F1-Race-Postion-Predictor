# F1-Race-Position-Predictor üèéÔ∏èüèÅ

This project is a **work in progress** aimed at building a regression model to predict the top 5 finishers for an F1 race weekend. The model utilizes practice session data, qualifying results, driver points, and potentially constructor points to analyze performance trends and forecast race outcomes.

## Features
- **Comprehensive Data Analysis**: Incorporates practice session data, qualifying results, and driver points, with plans to include constructor points for improved predictions.
- **Regression Modeling**: Uses regression techniques to predict finishing positions.

## Objectives
- Build an effective predictive model using regression techniques on F1 performance data.
- Explore the impact of different variables like qualifying results and driver/constructor points on race outcomes.
- Establish a foundation for more advanced and scalable predictive modeling.

## Tools and Technologies
- **Python**: Primary programming language for data handling and modeling.
- **Python Libraries**: Uses requests and BeautifulSoup for web scraping.
- **Key Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, and Scikit-learn for data processing and regression analysis.

## Future Directions
- Refining predictions by incorporating additional variables, such as constructor points and other data like conering speed, trap speed, weather, etc.
- Transitioning to advanced machine learning methods for better accuracy.
- Extending the model to predict results for the entire grid.
