# F1-Race-Position-Predictor üèéÔ∏èüèÅ

This project is a **work in progress** aimed at building a regression model to predict the top 5 finishers for an F1 race weekend. The model utilizes practice session data, qualifying results, driver points, and potentially constructor points to analyze performance trends and forecast race outcomes.

## Features
- **Comprehensive Data Analysis**: Incorporates practice session data, qualifying results, and driver points, with plans to include constructor points for improved predictions.
# F1-Race-Position-Predictor üèéÔ∏èüèÅ
