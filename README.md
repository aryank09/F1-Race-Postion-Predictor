# F1-Race-Position-Predictor üèéÔ∏èüèÅ

This project is a **work in progress** aimed at building a neural network-based deep learning model to predict the top 5 finishers for an F1 race weekend. The model leverages practice session data, qualifying results, and driver points to analyze performance trends and forecast race outcomes.

## Features
- **Comprehensive Data Analysis**: Incorporates practice session data, qualifying results, and driver points to deliver data-driven predictions.
- **Deep Learning Architecture**: Implements a neural network model for enhanced accuracy and scalability.

## Objectives
- Build an effective predictive model using deep learning techniques on F1 performance data.
- Explore the impact of different variables like qualifying results and driver points on race outcomes.
- Establish a robust framework for advanced and scalable predictive modeling.

## Tools and Technologies
- **Python**: Primary programming language for data handling and modeling.
- **Deep Learning Frameworks**: TensorFlow and Keras for constructing and training neural networks.
- **Python Libraries**: Pandas and NumPy for data preprocessing and analysis.
- **Web Scraping**: Utilizes requests and BeautifulSoup to collect real-world F1 data.

## Future Directions
- Refining predictions by incorporating additional variables, such as constructor points, cornering speed, trap speed, and weather conditions.
- Optimizing the neural network architecture for improved performance.
- Extending the model to predict results for the entire grid, not just the top 5.
